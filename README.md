# Permutation-Game

Alice and Bob play the following game:

They choose a permutation of the numbers 1 to N.
Alice plays first and they alternate.
In a turn, they can remove anyone remaining number from the permutation.
The game ends when the remaining numbers from an increasing sequence of 1 or more numbers. The person who played the turn that leaves an increasing sequence wins the game.
Assuming both plays optimally, who wins the game? Return Alice or Bob.
